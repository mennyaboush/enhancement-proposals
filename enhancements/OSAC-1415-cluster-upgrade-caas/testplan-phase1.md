# Testplan — OSAC-1415

## Overview

- **Feature:** OSAC-1415 — Cluster Upgrade CaaS (Stage 1)
- **Total test cases:** 47
- **Requirements with test cases:** 7 of 8 (FR-7, FR-8, FR-10, FR-11, FR-12, FR-13, NFR-1); NFR-2 is documentation
- **Interface changes covered:** 9 of 9 (IC-1 through IC-9)

PATCH steps below use semantic versions as shorthand; CP and NP desired versions are both `ClusterVersionReference` values on the wire, while observed versions are semver strings.

For NP cases, the public target is a CaaS node-set name. Current implementation maps it to a `NodeRequest` by resource class and then to a HyperShift NodePool by its `osac.openshift.io/resource_class` label. Targeting cases use different node-set and NodePool names so an index- or name-based lookup cannot pass accidentally. [OSAC-1604](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-1604) may change this mapping; update these cases to match its delivered identity when it lands.

### Upgrade-path coverage and ownership

| Behavior / cases | Tier and owner | Boundary and execution evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Upgrade-mode routing, resource-class selection, job idempotency, feedback (`TC-IC1-01`, `TC-IC1-01c`, `TC-IC2-01`, `TC-FR7-01`, `TC-FR7-03b`) | Envtest, osac-operator `[DEV]` | `make test` in `osac-operator/`; real Kubernetes API and controller, fake AAP client and simulated HyperShift status. This does not prove the AAP service boundary. |
| Shared HC/NP image patch, unique target validation, later scale preserving per-NP image (`TC-IC1-01`, `TC-IC2-01`, `TC-IC2-01b`, `TC-IC2-01c`) | Component integration, osac-aap `[DEV]` | Proposed target under `osac-aap/tests/integration/targets/`, run by `make test` in `osac-aap/`; real Kind API and Ansible tasks, no real AAP controller or HyperShift reconciliation. |
| AAP template launch, polling, and retry (`TC-IC1-01c`) | Contract, osac-operator/osac-aap `[DEV]` | No qualifying real-AAP contract suite is currently identified; follow [OSAC-4843](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-4843). A fake AAP client in Envtest covers caller logic only. |
| Deployed CP/NP upgrade and later scale (`TC-IC1-01`, `TC-IC2-01`, `TC-IC2-01b`) | E2E, `[QE]` | Proposed cases under `tests/e2e/` require deployed fulfillment-service, operator, AAP, and HyperShift; execution command and environment are unresolved pending the provider test setup in [OSAC-4843](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-4843). |

## Test Cases

---

### FR-7: Upgrade status surfaced

FR-7 requires upgrade state (progressing/succeeded/failed), source and target versions, and transition timestamps in cluster status.

#### TC-FR7-01: Upgrade status transitions Progressing → Succeeded

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-3 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster in `CLUSTER_STATE_READY`. `status.observed_cp_version = "4.16.5"`. Target ClusterVersion has `metadata.name = "4-17-3"`, `spec.version = "4.17.3"`, and is ACTIVE.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` with `spec.version = "4.17.3"`.
2. `GET /clusters/{id}` immediately after.
3. Simulate successful completion of the AAP patch job, then `GET /clusters/{id}`.
4. Simulate HyperShift signaling upgrade start; operator sets `upgradeStatus.state = Progressing` and sends private status feedback.
5. `GET /clusters/{id}`.
6. Simulate HyperShift completion; operator sets `upgradeStatus.state = Succeeded`, `completionTime`, `observedVersion = "4.17.3"`, and sends private status feedback.
7. `GET /clusters/{id}`.

##### Expected Results

- After step 1: HTTP 200, cluster state unchanged (READY), `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False`.
- After step 2: `status.upgrade.state = CLUSTER_UPGRADE_PROGRESS_STATE_PENDING` and `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False`.
- After step 3: `status.upgrade.state` is still `CLUSTER_UPGRADE_PROGRESS_STATE_PENDING`; AAP job success alone does not indicate HyperShift progress.
- After step 5: `status.upgrade.state = CLUSTER_UPGRADE_PROGRESS_STATE_PROGRESSING`, `from_version = "4.16.5"`, `to_version = "4.17.3"`, `started_at` is non-zero, `completed_at` is absent.
- After step 7: `status.upgrade.state = CLUSTER_UPGRADE_PROGRESS_STATE_SUCCEEDED`, `completed_at` is non-zero, `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = True`, `status.observed_cp_version = "4.17.3"`, and Cluster/ClusterOrder provisioning status is unchanged.

---

#### TC-FR7-01b: CP upgrade completion requires target image and semver in HC history

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-3 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- CP upgrade to `4.17.3` in progress (`conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False`). `HC.status.controlPlaneVersion.desired.image = ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage`, `desired.version = "4.17.3"`, and `history[0].state = "Partial"`.

##### Steps

1. Simulate `HC.status.controlPlaneVersion.history[0].state = "Completed"` but `history[0].image` still names the previous release image.
2. `GET /clusters/{id}`.
3. Simulate `HC.status.controlPlaneVersion.history[0].image = ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage`, but `version = "4.17.2"` and `state = "Completed"`; GET the Cluster.
4. Simulate `HC.status.controlPlaneVersion.history[0].version = "4.17.3"`.
5. `GET /clusters/{id}`.

##### Expected Results

- After step 2: `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False` — completion is not declared while the completed history image differs from the requested target.
- After step 3: `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False` while the completed history version differs from HyperShift's `desired.version = "4.17.3"`.
- After step 5: `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = True`, `status.upgrade.state = CLUSTER_UPGRADE_PROGRESS_STATE_SUCCEEDED`, `status.observed_cp_version = "4.17.3"`.

---

#### TC-FR7-02: Terminal upgrade failure releases the upgrade lock

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-3 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster in `CLUSTER_STATE_READY`. `observed_cp_version = "4.16.5"`. ClusterVersions `4.17.3` and `4.17.4` ACTIVE.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.17.3"`.
2. Simulate the operator reporting a terminal upgrade failure (detection criteria TBD): set `upgradeStatus.state = Failed`, `completionTime`, and an upgrade-specific message; send private status feedback.
3. `GET /clusters/{id}`.
4. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` with `spec.version = "4.17.4"`, replay the failed result for `4.17.3`, then `GET /clusters/{id}`.

##### Expected Results

- Step 3: `status.upgrade.state = CLUSTER_UPGRADE_PROGRESS_STATE_FAILED`, `completed_at` and the upgrade-specific message are set, `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = True`, Cluster state remains READY, ClusterOrder provisioning status is unchanged, and `status.observed_cp_version` remains `"4.16.5"`.
- Step 4: the new request is accepted; stale feedback does not release its lock. `status.upgrade.state = CLUSTER_UPGRADE_PROGRESS_STATE_PENDING` for `4.17.4` and `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False`.

---

#### TC-FR7-03: Upgrade timestamps are non-zero and ordered

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-3 | medium | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Completed upgrade scenario (TC-FR7-01 completed).

##### Steps

1. `GET /clusters/{id}` after upgrade completes.

##### Expected Results

- `status.upgrade.started_at` < `status.upgrade.completed_at`.
- Both timestamps are valid RFC 3339 / protobuf Timestamp values with non-zero seconds.

---

#### TC-FR7-03b: NP upgrade completion requires NodePool.status.version match

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-2, IC-4 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- NP upgrade for node set `workers` to `4.17.3` is in progress (`conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False`). Its resource class is `gpu` and its desired reference name is `4-17-3`. The `NodeRequest` with `ResourceClass="gpu"` has `Version="4.17.3"`; NodePool `pool-a` has `osac.openshift.io/resource_class=gpu` and `status.conditions[UpdatingVersion].status = True`.

##### Steps

1. Simulate `pool-a.status.conditions[UpdatingVersion].status = False` but `pool-a.status.version = "4.17.2"` (version mismatch).
2. `GET /clusters/{id}`.
3. Simulate `pool-a.status.version = "4.17.3"` with `UpdatingVersion=False`.
4. `GET /clusters/{id}`.

##### Expected Results

- After step 2: `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False` — completion not declared while `status.version != "4.17.3"`.
- After step 4: `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = True`, `status.node_sets["workers"].observed_version = "4.17.3"`.

---

### FR-10: One active upgrade per cluster

FR-10 requires that only one upgrade can be in progress at a time per cluster.

#### TC-FR10-01: Upgrade request rejected when upgrade already in progress

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-9 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Upgrade to `4.17.3` in progress; `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False`. ClusterVersion `4.17.4` ACTIVE.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.17.4"`.

##### Expected Results

- gRPC `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, message includes upgrade-in-progress reason from `CanUpgrade` condition. No change to `ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage`.

---

---

#### TC-FR10-03: NP upgrade rejected when CP upgrade already in progress

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-2, IC-9 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- CP upgrade to `4.17.3` in progress; `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False`. ClusterVersion `4.16.5` ACTIVE. Node pool `workers` at `4.15.5`.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.node_sets["workers"].version = "4.16.5"`.

##### Expected Results

- gRPC `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, message includes upgrade-in-progress reason from `CanUpgrade` condition. No `ClusterOrder.spec.nodeRequests` change.

---

#### TC-FR10-04: Upgrade rejected on FAILED cluster

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-9 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster in `CLUSTER_STATE_FAILED` because provisioning failed. ClusterVersion `4.17.3` ACTIVE.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.17.3"`.

##### Expected Results

- gRPC `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, message = `"cluster is in state FAILED and cannot be upgraded"`. No `ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage` change.

---

### FR-13: Upgrade history

FR-13 requires a record of past version transitions surfaced in cluster status.

#### TC-FR13-01: Completed upgrade appears in version history

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-3, IC-5 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster in `CLUSTER_STATE_READY`. `observed_cp_version = "4.16.5"`. ClusterVersion `4.17.3` ACTIVE.

##### Steps

1. Complete an upgrade from `4.16.5` to `4.17.3` (TC-FR7-01 scenario completed).
2. `GET /clusters/{id}`.

##### Expected Results

- `status.version_history` contains one entry: `from_version = "4.16.5"`, `to_version = "4.17.3"` (OpenShift semver, not catalog name `4-17-3`), `success = true`, `completed_at` is non-zero and matches `status.upgrade.completed_at`.

---

#### TC-FR13-02: Sequential upgrades accumulate history entries

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-5 | medium | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster with two completed sequential upgrades: `4.16.5 → 4.17.3`, then `4.17.3 → 4.17.5`.

##### Steps

1. `GET /clusters/{id}`.

##### Expected Results

- `status.version_history` contains 2 entries ordered by `completed_at` ascending.
- Entry 0: `from_version = "4.16.5"`, `to_version = "4.17.3"`, `success = true`.
- Entry 1: `from_version = "4.17.3"`, `to_version = "4.17.5"`, `success = true`.

---

#### TC-FR13-03: Failed upgrade does not appear in history

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-5 | medium | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster upgrade from `4.16.5` to `4.17.3` fails (TC-FR7-02 scenario).

##### Steps

1. `GET /clusters/{id}` after failure.

##### Expected Results

- `status.version_history` is empty (no entry for the failed upgrade attempt).

---

### NFR-1: UI support — version selection, status monitoring, history

NFR-1 requires that the API surface supports UI display of upgrade state, history, and version selection.

---

### IC-1: `PATCH /clusters/{id}` spec.version — CP upgrade trigger and validation

#### TC-IC1-01: CP upgrade on READY cluster patches HC through AAP only

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster `READY`. `observed_cp_version = "4.16.5"`. Node pools at `observed_version = "4.15.5"`. ClusterVersion `4.17.3` ACTIVE. Cluster has two node pools.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.17.3"`.
2. Reconcile the ClusterOrder and run the existing cluster AAP job in upgrade mode against the HC.

##### Expected Results

- HTTP 200. `ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage` is updated to the image from ClusterVersion `4.17.3`. The operator launches the configured create-hosted-cluster AAP template once in upgrade mode and does not patch HC itself. The playbook finds the existing HC, patches only `HostedCluster.spec.release.image`, and reads it back to confirm the target image; its install/post-install tasks do not run, and `NodePool.spec.release.image` values and other HC fields do not change. Cluster state is unchanged; `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False` is written in the acceptance transaction.

---

#### TC-IC1-01b: Only one concurrent upgrade request succeeds

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-9 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster in `CLUSTER_STATE_READY` with `CAN_UPGRADE=True` and `observed_cp_version = "4.16.5"`. ClusterVersions `4.17.3` and `4.17.4` are ACTIVE. Do not deliver upgrade completion feedback during the test.

##### Steps

1. Use a barrier to start two `PATCH /clusters/{id}` requests at the same time, for `spec.version = "4.17.3"` and `spec.version = "4.17.4"`.
2. Read the stored Cluster after both requests finish; reconcile it and read the derived `ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage`.

##### Expected Results

- One request returns HTTP 200; the other returns `FAILED_PRECONDITION` with the `CanUpgrade` reason.
- The stored Cluster version matches the successful request and has no stored release image; `CanUpgrade=False`. The reconciled `ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage` matches that version's `ClusterVersion.spec.image`. The rejected request changes nothing.

---

#### TC-IC1-01c: AAP upgrade-mode run failure retries without cluster reprovisioning

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- A CP upgrade to `4.17.3` is Pending. The existing HC still has the old image, and no upgrade job has succeeded for this target.

##### Steps

1. Reconcile once with the configured cluster AAP template unavailable; restore it and reconcile again.
2. Fail the launched AAP job before it patches HC; reconcile through the configured retry backoff.
3. Let the retried job patch HC successfully; restart the operator and reconcile again before HyperShift reports progress.

##### Expected Results

- Launch and patch failures retain `status.upgrade.state = Pending`, keep `CanUpgrade=False`, and expose an upgrade-specific message. The operator retries the configured AAP template in upgrade mode with backoff; its installation branch does not run.
- The recorded job ID prevents a duplicate launch while the job is active. After the image matches, restart does not launch another job. AAP job success alone leaves the upgrade Pending until HyperShift signals a start; ClusterOrder provisioning status is unchanged.

---

#### TC-IC1-02: Upgrade with OBSOLETE target version is rejected

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-9 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- ClusterVersion `4.17.3` exists with `state = OBSOLETE`. Cluster in `READY`.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.17.3"`.

##### Expected Results

- gRPC `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, message = `"version 4.17.3 is obsolete and cannot be used as an upgrade target"`. No `ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage` change.

---

#### TC-IC1-03: Upgrade with DEPRECATED target version is accepted

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- ClusterVersion `4.17.3` with `state = DEPRECATED`. `observed_cp_version = "4.16.5"`. Cluster `READY`.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.17.3"`.

##### Expected Results

- HTTP 200. `ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage` updated to DEPRECATED version's image (DEPRECATED is allowed as upgrade target).

---

#### TC-IC1-04: Downgrade is rejected

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-9 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- `observed_cp_version = "4.17.3"`. ClusterVersion `4.16.5` ACTIVE. Cluster `READY`.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.16.5"`.

##### Expected Results

- gRPC `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, message = `"target version 4.16.5 is not greater than current version 4.17.3"`.

---

#### TC-IC1-05: Same-version upgrade is rejected

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-9 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- `observed_cp_version = "4.17.3"`. ClusterVersion `4.17.3` ACTIVE. Cluster `READY`.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.17.3"`.

##### Expected Results

- gRPC `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, message = `"target version 4.17.3 is not greater than current version 4.17.3"`.

---

#### TC-IC1-06: Upgrade rejected when PROGRESSING + HC not yet available (CanUpgrade=False)

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-9 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster in `CLUSTER_STATE_PROGRESSING` (initial provisioning in progress). HC `Available=False` and Cluster `READY=False`. Fulfillment created the Cluster with `CAN_UPGRADE=False`. ClusterVersion `4.17.3` ACTIVE.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.17.3"`.

##### Expected Results

- gRPC `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, message identifies missing Cluster `READY=True` feedback. No `ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage` change. Blocking rule: DB `CAN_UPGRADE=False`.

---

#### TC-IC1-07: Upgrade allowed on PROGRESSING cluster (AAP tasks running)

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- A new Cluster with two node sets and selected ClusterVersion `spec.version="4.16.5"` was stored with `CAN_UPGRADE=False` in its creation transaction. `CLUSTER_STATE_PROGRESSING` persists while AAP post-provisioning tasks run. `ClusterOrder.conditions[ClusterAvailable]=True`, but Cluster `READY=True` feedback has not yet been stored. Observed versions are empty. ClusterVersion `4.17.3` ACTIVE.

##### Steps

1. Deliver Cluster `READY=True` through private status feedback while `ClusterOrder.phase=Progressing`.
2. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.17.3"`.

##### Expected Results

- Create stored both desired node-set version references equal to the selected CP reference with `CAN_UPGRADE=False` in one transaction.
- Step 1 stores `READY=True`, the CP and both node-set observed semver baselines (`"4.16.5"`), and `CAN_UPGRADE=True` in one transaction while Cluster state remains `PROGRESSING`.
- Step 2 returns HTTP 200 and stores the upgrade target with `CAN_UPGRADE=False` in one transaction.

---

#### TC-IC1-07b: Upgrade allowed on PROGRESSING cluster (failed AAP post-provisioning)

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster in `CLUSTER_STATE_PROGRESSING` with `READY=True` and DB `CAN_UPGRADE=True`; AAP post-provisioning tasks subsequently failed. `observed_cp_version = "4.16.5"`. ClusterVersion `4.17.3` ACTIVE.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.17.3"`.

##### Expected Results

- HTTP 200, cluster state unchanged (PROGRESSING), `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False`. Failed AAP post-provisioning does not block the upgrade at the API level.

---

#### TC-IC1-08: Upgrade rejected when HC Available but Cluster READY=False

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-9 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster in `CLUSTER_STATE_PROGRESSING` (initial provisioning; HC created and Available=True) with Cluster `READY=False` and DB `CAN_UPGRADE=False`. ClusterVersion `4.17.3` ACTIVE.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.17.3"`.

##### Expected Results

- gRPC `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, message identifies missing Cluster `READY=True` feedback. No `ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage` change. Blocking rule: DB `CAN_UPGRADE=False`.

---

#### TC-IC1-09: CP upgrade rejected when target version is not in the catalog

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-9 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- No ClusterVersion with name or version string `"4.99.0"` exists in the catalog.
  Cluster in `READY`. `observed_cp_version = "4.16.5"`.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.99.0"`.

##### Expected Results

- gRPC `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, message = `"version 4.99.0 not found in the ClusterVersion catalog"`.
  No DB write. No `ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage` change.

---

#### TC-IC2-05: NP upgrade rejected before Cluster READY feedback (CanUpgrade=False)

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-2, IC-9 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster in `CLUSTER_STATE_PROGRESSING` (initial provisioning) with Cluster `READY=False` and DB `CAN_UPGRADE=False`. Node pool `workers` has not reached its requested version. ClusterVersion `4.17.0` ACTIVE.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.node_sets["workers"].version = "4.17.0"`.

##### Expected Results

- gRPC `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, message identifies missing Cluster `READY=True` feedback. No `ClusterOrder.spec.nodeRequests` change. Blocking rule: DB `CAN_UPGRADE=False`.

---

#### TC-IC1-10: Upgrade accepted when ControlPlaneAvailable=False (cluster-internal state, not an API gate)

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster in `CLUSTER_STATE_READY`. HC `Available=True`, version converged. **`ControlPlaneAvailable=False`** (cluster-internal: CP temporarily unreachable). `CAN_UPGRADE=True` (ControlPlaneAvailable is not included in CanUpgrade). ClusterVersion `4.17.3` ACTIVE.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.17.3"`.

##### Expected Results

- HTTP 200, cluster state unchanged (READY), `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False`. `ControlPlaneAvailable=False` is a cluster-internal state not captured by `CanUpgrade` — the upgrade is accepted and the operator launches the AAP patch job. Whether HyperShift progresses depends on its responsiveness.

---

#### TC-IC1-11: CP upgrade rejected when target version violates N-3 skew against existing node pool

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-9 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- `observed_cp_version = "4.17.3"`. Node pool `workers` at `observed_version = "4.14.5"` (CP-NP skew = 3, at the limit). ClusterVersion `4.18.0` ACTIVE. Cluster `READY`.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.version = "4.18.0"`.

##### Expected Results

- gRPC `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, message = `"target control plane version 4.18.0 would leave node pool workers at 4.14.5 more than 3 minor versions behind"`. No `ClusterOrder.spec.ReleaseImage` change.

---

### IC-2: `PATCH /clusters/{id}` spec.node_sets[*].version — NP upgrade trigger and validation

#### TC-IC2-01: NP upgrade on READY cluster patches the target NodePool through AAP only

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-2 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Cluster `READY`. `observed_cp_version = "4.17.3"`. Node set `workers` uses resource class `gpu` and has `observed_version = "4.16.5"`; the other node set uses `cpu`. Their existing NodePools are named `pool-a` (`osac.openshift.io/resource_class=gpu`) and `pool-b` (`osac.openshift.io/resource_class=cpu`), deliberately different from the node-set names. ClusterVersion `4.17.3` is ACTIVE.

##### Steps

1. `PATCH /clusters/{id}` `spec.node_sets["workers"].version = "4.17.3"`.
2. Reconcile the ClusterOrder and run the existing cluster AAP job in upgrade mode for the NP upgrade.
3. Simulate `pool-a` completing at `4.17.3`, deliver private status feedback, and read the public Cluster.

##### Expected Results

- After step 1: HTTP 200, cluster state unchanged, and `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = False` written in the acceptance transaction.
- After step 2: The `NodeRequest` with `ResourceClass="gpu"` receives the image from ClusterVersion `4.17.3`; the `cpu` request is unchanged. The operator selects `pool-a` by its resource-class label and launches the configured create-hosted-cluster AAP template once in upgrade mode with internal component `node_pool:gpu`. The playbook confirms a unique associated `gpu` NodePool, patches only `pool-a.spec.release.image`, and reads it back. Install/post-install tasks do not run, and the HostedCluster image, `pool-b` image, and other NP fields do not change.
- After step 3: Public `status.upgrade.component` and the new history entry use `node_pool:workers`; only `status.node_sets["workers"].observed_version` advances to `4.17.3`. `conditions[CAN_UPGRADE].status = True`, and cluster provisioning state is unchanged.

---

#### TC-IC2-01b: Later scaling preserves an independently upgraded NodePool image

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-2 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- The CP and another NP are at `4.18.0`; `workers` completed an independent upgrade from `4.16.5` to `4.17.3`, and its `NodeRequest` contains the `4.17.3` image.

##### Steps

1. Change only `workers` desired node count to trigger the existing scaling/create-hosted-cluster AAP path.
2. Run the scaling playbook and read the HC and both NodePool specs.

##### Expected Results

- Scaling changes the replica count without resetting the NodePool matched to `workers` from the `4.17.3` image to the CP's `4.18.0` image. The HC and other NP images remain unchanged, and no upgrade job is launched for the scale-only change.

#### TC-IC2-01c: Shared upgrade patch fails for missing, ambiguous, or mismatched targets

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1, IC-2 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- A component-integration environment has the cluster working namespace, a `ClusterOrder`, and a valid CP or NP upgrade-mode payload.

##### Steps

1. Run the shared upgrade patch with the selected HC absent; repeat with the selected NP absent.
2. Create HC and NP resources with a mismatched ClusterOrder association, then repeat each patch.
3. For an NP upgrade, provide two associated NodePools with the selected resource-class label; repeat with no NodePool carrying that label.
4. Run the CP and NP patches against correctly associated resources with exactly one matching NP, then read both resources.

##### Expected Results

- Each missing, ambiguous, or mismatched target fails the AAP playbook without creating a resource or changing an image. A `state: patched` missing-resource warning alone is not accepted as success.
- A target-validation failure is reported as a terminal upgrade failure rather than retried indefinitely; fulfillment releases `CanUpgrade` while Cluster and ClusterOrder provisioning state remain unchanged.
- Each valid run changes only its selected resource's `spec.release.image`, confirms the value by readback, and leaves the other resource and all unrelated spec fields unchanged. Installation and post-install tasks do not run.

## Gaps

### Requirement Coverage Gaps

| Requirement | Gap |
|-------------|-----|
| FR-8 (NP version capped at CP version) | Tested by TC-IC2-02 (NP upgrade rejected when target version exceeds CP version). |
| FR-11 (NP version cap follows CP; no concurrent CP+NP upgrade) | NP version cap: tested by TC-IC2-02. TC-FR10-03 rejects an NP request during a CP upgrade; TC-FR10-01 rejects a CP request during an unspecified active upgrade. A CP request during an NP upgrade is not explicitly covered. |
| FR-12 (unsupported version skews blocked) | Tested by TC-IC2-03 (NP upgrade N-3 skew rejection) and TC-IC1-11 (CP upgrade N-3 skew rejection against existing NPs). |
| NFR-2 (user documentation) | Documentation requirement; no automated test applicable. Documentation must be produced as a separate deliverable. |

### Interface Change Coverage Gaps

All 9 interface changes are covered by test cases. No gaps.
